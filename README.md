# Suppress Cache

Install it directly from the [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mrrobotdotapp/suppresscache):

```bash
npm i @mrrobotdotapp/suppresscache
```

This file is used on [the bot](https://mrrobot.app) for no cache files from CDNs. 
Discord uses CloudFlare for caching management which can be problematic when you change an image and display it on the platform.
Even after a change on your side, Discord can still keep the old version in its cache.

> **Note**
> 
> Formerly called **NoCache**, it has been renamed because the package name on NPM already exists.

## ðŸ’» Code

```js
const { getFolderIcons } = require('@mrrobotdotapp/suppresscache');

getFolderIcons(
  "https://mrrobot.app/Folder/Of/Icons",
  "myFileName.png",
  true,
  false
)
```

Give that :

```bash
[suppressCache] Output : https://mrrobot.app/Folder/Of/Icons/file.png?suppressCache=gb0cqe0j
```

You can test this code directly with [`./test/app.js`](./test/app.js).
