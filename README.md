# NoCache

This file is used on [the bot](https://mrrobot.app) for no cache files from CDNs. 
Discord uses CloudFlare for caching management which can be problematic when you change an image and display it on the platform. 
Even after a change on your side, Discord can still keep the old version in its cache.

### ðŸ’» Code

```js
const FolderIcons = 'https://mrrobot.app/Folder/Of/Icons'
const NoCacheVersion = '1'

function getFolderIcons(file, log, desactivated) {
    let GenNumberCache
    if (!desactivated) {
        GenNumberCache = Math.round(Math.random() * 0xFFFFFFFFFF).toString(30)
    } else {
        GenNumberCache = NoCacheVersion
    }
    if (log) console.log(`[NoCache] Output : ${FolderIcons}/${file}?NoCache=${GenNumberCache}`)
    return `${FolderIcons}/${file}?NoCache=${GenNumberCache}`
}

getFolderIcons('file.png', true)
```
